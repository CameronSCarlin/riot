## Introduction

League of Legends is a 5 vs. 5 team based multiplayer game where the goal is to try to destroy the base of the opposing team. This is done by killing enemies and strong neutral monsters like Dragons and Barons, with the goal of destroying towers and the opponent's Nexus. Each person playing plays a particular character, called a champion, with a unique role and set of abilities that have individual strengths and weaknesses. Together, a team with strong teamwork and diverse roles ultimately has the best opportunity of success. 

## Summary

To be brief, all of the data visualized in this application are distinguishing factors that differentiate likelihood of winning and playstyle. Having a team that works together, and therefore having a team that assists one another, ultimately leads to a higher likelihood of winning. The champion one selects also matters due to their individual skills, strengths, and weaknesses. Ultimately, things like gold collection and kills have a different impact on game outcome based on when they occur in a given game. Lastly, an individual's rank, or skill level, gives insight as to how well they are playing League of Legends, and the roles played also can show clear distinctions within their end game statistics.

## Data Description
